# Churn prediction

- Type of challenge: Learning
- Duration: `1 weeks`
- Deadline : `30/02/24 12:30`(code)
- Presentation : `30/02/24 15:45`
- Team challenge: Solo project

## Mission objectives

- Build machine learning models for classification.
- Build machine learning models for clustering.
- Select the right performance metrics for your model.
- Identify the optimal number of clusters and be able to describe them.
- Tuning parameters of the model for better performance.
- Describe the results from unsupervised learning.
- Online deployment of dashboard with data insights.

## The Mission

An important financial institution is interested in analyzing its client database to increase the revenue generated from credit cardholders. They are concern about customers closing their bank accounts after accepting products from other institutions.

The churn rate is above 15% and increasing, the CEO urges the marketing team to start a marketing campaign for client retention.

Your mission:

- Predict those clients with more propensity to close their bank account with the financial institution
- Find possible groups of clients and define their characteristics. This will help the marketing team to design custom-made campaigns to increase customer retention.
- Build a dashboard with data insights and KPIs.

#### What is Churn Rate ?

_The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. It is most commonly expressed as the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period._

### Must-have features

- Implementation of machine learning models according to the client's requirements.
- The performance metrics of the model must be clearly defined.
- Evaluation of the model's performance and definition of its limitations.
- Different unsupervised learning algorithms were explored.
- Explanation of the results obtained using unsupervised learning.
- The dashboard is deployed online : bonnus

### Miscellaneous information

The dataset can be downloaded on the following link:

### Constraints

- Create **functions**, do **not** create a single huge script
- Each **function** has to be typed : bonus
- Your code should be **commented**
- Your code should be **cleaned of any commented unused code**.

## Deliverables

1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
2. **Small presentation (8 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A) about your findings**
3. Dashboard representative of data insights
4. Pimp up the README file:
   - Description
   - Installation
   - Usage
   - ⚠️ **DATA SOURCES**
   - (Visuals)
   - (Contributors)
   - (Timeline)
   - (Personal situation)
5. Online dashboard.
